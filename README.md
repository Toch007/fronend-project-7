## My process

I started off by creating the HTML structure of the page. Then I proceeded to the CSS. The best
way to execute the project in my opinion is with the use of Grid. I successfully completed using 
the grid display. I struggled a bit with the font-side because it is not exactly the same with the 
design. I made the page responsive setting the grid properties to a media query min-width of 800px. 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow



### What I learned

I temporarily forgot how to position the item I am working on the center of the page. Thanks to Kelvin Powells 
tutorial which I used to remind myself.
